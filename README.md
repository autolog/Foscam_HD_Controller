# Overview

The Autolog Foscam HD Controller is a plugin for version 7+ of the [Indigo Home Automation system][1]. It enables you to control [Foscam][2] HD camera devices directly from Indigo. It enables local LAN control of the Foscam HD camera devices without having to use an internet connection. It facilitates the downloading of snapped images as a result of motion being detected by a Foscam HD camera.

It works in conjunction with the Dynamic View Controller to allow the downloaded images to be displayed in a Control Page.

It is **strongly recommended** to read the [Wiki Documentation][3] to familiarise yourself with the how the plugin works.
